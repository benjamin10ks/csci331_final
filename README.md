# How to Run

While in the casino_app directory:

create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file in apps/server

`npm install` to install dependencies

NEED TO FIGURE OUT AUTO MIGRATIONS FOR POSTGRES
FOR NOW `npm run start:db` and `node scripts/migrate.js` to set up DB

THEN

`npm run dev` to start client server and DB server

That's it!!
